    "* [Data Portals](http://dataportals.org/)  - a massive list of 551 (as of this writing) open data portals from all over the world, each of which has its own library of data sets to offer. You can browse geographically (or alphabetically) and you can also search by keyword. Most portals here are government-run open data portals.\n",

    "* [Data.world](https://data.world/)  - Kind of like GitHub for data. You’ll find all kinds of datasets here, although some of them will include common and popular data sets like the Titanic passenger data, and since they’re user-uploaded they may not always be accurate or reliable.\n",
    "* [/r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/)  - A subreddit for sharing datasets. Years of history to browse through, new stuff every day, and you can even make requests!\n",
